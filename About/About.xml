  <description>
  A smart replacement for RimWorld's vanilla "Kill" debug tool that intelligently prioritizes targets instead of killing everything indiscriminately.

üéØ INTELLIGENT TARGETING
Instead of destroying everything under your cursor, this mod kills only the most relevant target based on a logical priority system. Perfect for developers and modders who need precision control.

‚ö° PRIORITY SYSTEM (Highest ‚Üí Lowest)
1. Hostile Pawns - Raiders, manhunters, hostile faction members
2. Mechanoids - Both active and dormant mechanoids
3. Wild Animals - Including manhunters and aggressive wildlife  
4. Items - Weapons, apparel, resources, dropped goods
5. Buildings - Structures, furniture, doors, turrets
6. Corpses - Dead bodies and remains
7. Environmental - Filth, plants, debris, neutral objects
8. Friendlies - Colonists and tamed animals (safety last)

üõ†Ô∏è POWERFUL FEATURES
‚Ä¢ Smart single-target mode (default) or configurable radius mode
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive mod settings with individual target type toggles
‚Ä¢ Distance-based prioritization when priorities match
‚Ä¢ Optional debug logging to see what was killed and why
‚Ä¢ Safety-first design: colonists only targeted if nothing else available
‚Ä¢ Real-time settings changes (no restart required)
‚Ä¢ Maintains all original debug tool permissions

üîß DEVELOPER FRIENDLY
Perfect for mod testing, map cleanup, and precise debugging. Saves time by eliminating the need to manually select specific targets in crowded scenes while maintaining the safety and power of the original tool.

Compatible with all other mods. No performance impact during normal gameplay.
