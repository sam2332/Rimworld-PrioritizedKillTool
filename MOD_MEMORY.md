# Mod Development Memory

## Development Session - July 24, 2025

### Completed Work
1. **Created mod structure** with proper About.xml and manifest
2. **Implemented Harmony patch** to replace `DebugToolsGeneral.Kill()` method
3. **Built priority system** as specified in Mod_Base.md requirements
4. **Successfully compiled** mod without errors
5. **Added comprehensive mod settings system** with GUI
6. **Implemented radius mode** for area-of-effect killing
7. **Added target type toggles** for each priority category

### Key Implementation Details - Updated
- Used `Selector.SelectableObjectsAt()` to get all things at mouse position
- Implemented 8-tier priority system (0=highest, 7=lowest)
- Added reflection-based access to `Thing.allowDestroyNonDestroyable` for debug compatibility
- Added comprehensive logging to show what was killed and why
- **NEW**: Full mod settings integration with `ModSettings` class
- **NEW**: Radius mode with configurable area (0.5-10 tiles)
- **NEW**: Individual target type toggles for fine-grained control
- **NEW**: Distance-based prioritization option
- **NEW**: Settings persistence through `ExposeData`

### Settings Features Added
- **Target Type Controls**: Toggle each of the 8 priority categories
- **Radius Mode**: Switch between single-target and area-effect modes
- **Configurable Radius**: Slider for 0.5 to 10 tile radius
- **Log Toggle**: Enable/disable debug messages
- **Distance Priority**: Prefer closer targets when priority is tied
- **Reset to Defaults**: One-click reset button
- **Safety Warnings**: Clear labeling for dangerous options (colonist killing)

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Harmony Prefix Patch**: Completely replaces original method rather than modifying it
- **Single Target Selection**: Only kills the highest priority target, never multiple
- **Reflection for Safety**: Uses AccessTools to maintain debug tool permissions
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Shows priority reasoning for debugging/feedback

### API Research Findings
- `HostileTo(Faction.OfPlayer)` works correctly for determining hostile pawns
- `RaceProps.IsMechanoid` properly identifies mechanoids
- `IsColonist` and `Faction == Faction.OfPlayer` identify friendly pawns
- `SelectableObjectsAt()` returns all things the player can interact with at a position

### Build Status
✅ **Successfully built** - PrioritizedKillTool.dll generated in Assemblies folder
✅ **No compilation errors** - All syntax and reference issues resolved
✅ **Ready for testing** in RimWorld

### Next Steps (if needed)
1. Test in actual RimWorld gameplay
2. Verify priority system works as expected
3. Test edge cases (empty cells, multiple targets of same priority)
4. Consider adding visual feedback or settings

### Files Created
- `About/About.xml` - Mod metadata
- `About/manifest.xml` - Version info  
- `Source/PrioritizedKillToolMod.cs` - Main implementation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical documentation
- `MOD_MEMORY.md` - This file

### Performance Considerations
- Uses efficient LINQ operations for sorting
- Minimal reflection usage (only for debug permissions)
- No ongoing performance overhead (only runs when debug tool is used)
